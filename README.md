##About ProgSelector

ProgSelector is a fully offline tool that allows you to choose whether you want to open a `.dll` or `.exe` file in Visual Studio or dnSpy, provided that you have Visual Studio installed, along with dnSpy installed at C:\dnSpy. ProgSelector does not work for preview or insider versions of Visual Studio. ProgSelector works with the Community, Professional, and Enterprise versions of Visual Studio. For your information the attached MSI installer was made with Advanced Installer. The `.aip` files used to build the installer are not publicly available for privacy reasons. However, you are free to use, modify, and redistribute the installers under the license terms of this software. If you would like to set ProgSelector as your default application to open .dll files, you will need to set that manually as the MSI installer will not do that. ProgSelector does not auto-update. Different versions of ProgSelector are designed for different versions of Visual Studio as follows:
